# Simple-Buffer
Simple buffer using a non built-in semaphore

# Project Description
- Given N numbers and one file, our system simulates a real-life of
how buffering is run where a user will decide N to get the prime
numbers from 0 to N. 
- The producer schedules the
prime numbers in a queue and the consumer will use this queue to write them
in the file.
- This project uses Java Swing for implementing a GUI
